# Cat_Mouse_Cheese_Race
The course project tries to solve the problem of mouse reaching the cheese, placed at the target, by navigating in a maze, and avoiding the cat who is chasing him. The objective is to train the agent mouse to reach the cheese in the minimum number of moves, without getting caught by the cat, by using reinforcement learning algorithms.
